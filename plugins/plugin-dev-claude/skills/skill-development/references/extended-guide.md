# Progressive Disclosure in Practice

## Progressive Disclosure in Practice

### What Goes in SKILL.md

**Include (always loaded when skill triggers):**

- Core concepts and overview
- Essential procedures and workflows
- Quick reference tables
- Pointers to references/examples/scripts
- Most common use cases

**Keep under 3,000 words, ideally 1,500-2,000 words**

### What Goes in references/

**Move to references/ (loaded as needed):**

- Detailed patterns and advanced techniques
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Migration guides
- Edge cases and troubleshooting
- Extensive examples and walkthroughs

**Each reference file can be large (2,000-5,000+ words)**

### What Goes in examples/

**Working code examples:**

- Complete, runnable scripts
- Configuration files
- Template files
- Real-world usage examples

**Users can copy and adapt these directly**

### What Goes in scripts/

**Utility scripts:**

- Validation tools
- Testing helpers
- Parsing utilities
- Automation scripts

**Should be executable and documented**

## Writing Style Requirements

### Imperative/Infinitive Form

Write using verb-first instructions, not second person:

**Correct (imperative):**

```
To create a hook, define the event type.
Configure the MCP server with authentication.
Validate settings before use.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**

```
You should create a hook by defining the event type.
You need to configure the MCP server.
You must validate settings before use.
```

### Third-Person in Description

The frontmatter description must use third person:

**Correct:**

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**

```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load this skill when user asks...
```

### Objective, Instructional Language

Focus on what to do, not who should do it:

**Correct:**

```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**

```
You can parse the frontmatter...
Claude should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a skill:

**Structure:**

- [ ] SKILL.md file exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name` and `description` fields
- [ ] Markdown body is present and substantial
- [ ] Referenced files actually exist

**Description Quality:**

- [ ] Uses third person ("This skill should be used when...")
- [ ] Includes specific trigger phrases users would say
- [ ] Lists concrete scenarios ("create X", "configure Y")
- [ ] Not vague or generic

**Content Quality:**

- [ ] SKILL.md body uses imperative/infinitive form
- [ ] Body is focused and lean (1,500-2,000 words ideal, <5k max)
- [ ] Detailed content moved to references/
- [ ] Examples are complete and working
- [ ] Scripts are executable and documented

**Progressive Disclosure:**

- [ ] Core concepts in SKILL.md
- [ ] Detailed docs in references/
- [ ] Working code in examples/
- [ ] Utilities in scripts/
- [ ] SKILL.md references these resources

**Testing:**

- [ ] Skill triggers on expected user queries
- [ ] Content is helpful for intended tasks
- [ ] No duplicated information across files
- [ ] References load when needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Weak Trigger Description

❌ **Bad:**

```yaml
description: Provides guidance for working with hooks.
```

**Why bad:** Vague, no specific trigger phrases, not third person

✅ **Good:**

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", or mentions hook events. Provides comprehensive hooks API guidance.
```

**Why good:** Third person, specific phrases, concrete scenarios

### Mistake 2: Too Much in SKILL.md

❌ **Bad:**

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md  (8,000 words - everything in one file)
```

**Why bad:** Bloats context when skill loads, detailed content always loaded

✅ **Good:**

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md  (1,800 words - core essentials)
└── references/
    ├── patterns.md (2,500 words)
    └── advanced.md (3,700 words)
```

**Why good:** Progressive disclosure, detailed content loaded only when needed

### Mistake 3: Second Person Writing

❌ **Bad:**

```markdown
You should start by reading the configuration file.
You need to validate the input.
You can use the grep tool to search.
```

**Why bad:** Second person, not imperative form

✅ **Good:**

```markdown
Start by reading the configuration file.
Validate the input before processing.
Use the grep tool to search for patterns.
```

**Why good:** Imperative form, direct instructions

### Mistake 4: Missing Resource References

❌ **Bad:**

```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

[No mention of references/ or examples/]
```

**Why bad:** Claude doesn't know references exist

✅ **Good:**

```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

- **`references/patterns.md`** - Detailed patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced techniques

### Examples

- **`examples/script.sh`** - Working example
```

**Why good:** Claude knows where to find additional information

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Skill

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

Good for: Simple knowledge, no complex resources needed

### Standard Skill (Recommended)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── examples/
    └── working-example.sh
```

Good for: Most plugin skills with detailed documentation

### Complete Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── patterns.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── examples/
│   ├── example1.sh
│   └── example2.json
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh
```

Good for: Complex domains with validation utilities

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **DO:**

- Use third-person in description ("This skill should be used when...")
- Include specific trigger phrases ("create X", "configure Y")
- Keep SKILL.md lean (1,500-2,000 words)
- Use progressive disclosure (move details to references/)
- Write in imperative/infinitive form
- Reference supporting files clearly
- Provide working examples
- Create utility scripts for common operations
- Study plugin-dev's skills as templates

❌ **DON'T:**

- Use second person anywhere
- Have vague trigger conditions
- Put everything in SKILL.md (>3,000 words without references/)
- Write in second person ("You should...")
- Leave resources unreferenced
- Include broken or incomplete examples
- Skip validation

## Additional Resources

### Study These Skills

Plugin-dev's skills demonstrate best practices:

- `../hook-development/` - Progressive disclosure, utilities
- `../agent-development/` - AI-assisted creation, references
- `../mcp-integration/` - Comprehensive references
- `../plugin-settings/` - Real-world examples
- `../command-development/` - Clear critical concepts
- `../plugin-structure/` - Good organization

### Reference Files

For complete skill-creator methodology:

- **`references/skill-creator-original.md`** - Full original skill-creator content

## Implementation Workflow

To create a skill for your plugin:

1. **Understand use cases**: Identify concrete examples of skill usage
2. **Plan resources**: Determine what scripts/references/examples needed
3. **Create structure**: `mkdir -p skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}`
4. **Write SKILL.md**:
   - Frontmatter with third-person description and trigger phrases
   - Lean body (1,500-2,000 words) in imperative form
   - Reference supporting files
5. **Add resources**: Create references/, examples/, scripts/ as needed
6. **Validate**: Check description, writing style, organization
7. **Test**: Verify skill loads on expected triggers
8. **Iterate**: Improve based on usage

Focus on strong trigger descriptions, progressive disclosure, and imperative writing style for effective skills that load when needed and provide targeted guidance.
