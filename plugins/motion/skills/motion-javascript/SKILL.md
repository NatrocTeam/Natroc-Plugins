# Motion for JavaScript

Motion is an animation library that's easy to start and fun to master.

Its unique hybrid engine combines the performance of the browser with the limitless potential of a JavaScript engine. This means you can animate anything, like:

- **HTML/CSS**
- **SVG** (like path drawing animations)
- **WebGL**(3D graphics)

The best part? It's also tiny, with a mini HTML/SVG version of the `animate()` function that's just 2.3kb!

By the end of this quick guide, you'll have installed Motion and made your first animation.

## Install

You can install Motion in two ways:

1. A package manager like npm or Yarn (**most popular)**
2. HTML `script` tag

### Package manager

Motion can be installed via the `"motion"` package.

```
npm install motion
```

Then imported in your JavaScript:

```
import { animate, scroll } from "motion"
```

### script tag

It's possible to import Motion directly using a `script` tag. This is perfect if you're working with a basic HTML page, or using a no-code tool like Webflow.

Import using the modern `import` syntax:

```
<script type="module">
  import { animate, scroll } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/motion@latest/+esm"
</script>
```

Or you can add `Motion` as a global variable using the legacy include:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/motion@latest/dist/motion.js"></script>
<script>
  const { animate, scroll } = Motion
</script>
```

### Create an animation

The "Hello world!" of any animation library is a simple transform animation.

Let's start by importing the `animate`[function](./docs/animations/animate.md).

```
import { animate } from "motion"
```

`animate` can animate one or more elements. You can either use a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll#obtaining_a_list_of_matches) (like `".my-class"`) or provide the elements directly:

```
// CSS selector
animate(".box", { rotate: 360 })

// Elements
const boxes = document.querySelectorAll(".box")

animate(boxes, { rotate: 360 })
```

You can see here we're setting `rotate` to `360`. This will rotate the element 360 degrees:

## What can be animated?

Motion lets you animate anything:

- **CSS properties** (like `opacity`, `transform` and `filter`)
- **SVG attributes and paths**
- **Independent transforms**(`x`, `rotateY` etc)
- **JavaScript objects** (containing strings/colors/numbers)

With Motion, you don't have to worry about achieving the best performance available. When a value can be hardware accelerated, like `opacity`, `filter` or `transform`, it will be.

`animate` isn't limited to HTML. It can animate single values or any kind of object. For example, the rotation of a Three.js object:

```
animate(
  cube.rotation,
  { y: rad(360), z: rad(360) },
  { duration: 10, repeat: Infinity, ease: "linear" }
)
```

## Customising animations

Motion comes with smart defaults, so your animations should look and feel great out of the box. But you can further tweak options like:

- **Duration** (how long the animation lasts)
- **Delay**(how long it waits before starting)
- **Easing** (how it speeds up and slows down)
- **Repeat** (how it repeats, how many times, etc)

```
animate(
  element,
  { scale: [0.4, 1] },
  { ease: "circInOut", duration: 1.2 }
);
```

Motion also has amazing [spring animations](./docs/utils/spring.md) for natural, kinetic animations:

```
animate(
  element,
  { rotate: 90 },
  { type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }
);
```

## Stagger animations

When animating multiple elements, it can feel more natural or lively to offset the animations of each. This is called **staggering**.

Motion provides a `stagger` function that can be used to dynamically set `delay`:

```
import { animate, stagger } from "motion"

animate(
  "li",
  { y: 0, opacity: 1 },
  { delay: stagger(0.1) }
)
```

### What's next?

You've just learned the basics of Motion and created a simple animation. But there's so much more to discover, like:

- [**Keyframes and sequences**](./docs/animations/animate.md): Create more complex animations
- [**Controls**](./docs/animations/animate.md): Pause, resume or change animations
- [**Scroll-linked animations**](./docs/animations/scroll.md)**:** Link values to scroll position
- [**Scroll-triggered animations**](./docs/gestures/inView.md): Trigger animations when elements enter the viewport
